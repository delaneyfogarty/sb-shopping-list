## The Golden Rule

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model.
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
  - What are the key/value pairs?
  - What arrays might you need?
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)

MY PLAN ##
1.) Make a wire frame.
2.) Create table on supabase.
3.) On list page...
    A. Form to input shopping items
    B. Div for shopping items to show up
    C. Delete button to blow up the list
4.) EVENTS
    A. On LOAD, fetch and display the list of shopping items...
    - window load event listener
    - get items from this user from SB
    - loop through the items, render, and append
        1.) each item is clickable
    B. On SUBMIT of form, add item to shopping list...
    - get data from the form
    - call createItem fxn
    - re-fetch & re-append
    C. On CLICK of delete button, destroy the list
    - clear out the DOM
    - delete every item on SB table
    D. On CLICK of an item, "buy it" and cross it out
    - update this item's "is_bought" property to true
    - re-fetch & re-append
